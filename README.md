# Genetic Algorithm for the 0/1 Knapsack Problem

This Python script implements a genetic algorithm to solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, a classic optimization problem in computer science.

## Problem Description
The 0/1 Knapsack Problem involves a knapsack with a fixed capacity and a set of items, each with a weight and a value. The goal is to determine the combination of items to include in the knapsack to maximize the total value while ensuring that the total weight does not exceed the capacity of the knapsack. Each item can be either included in the knapsack (1) or excluded from it (0).

## Algorithm Overview
The genetic algorithm implemented in this script follows the basic steps of a genetic algorithm:

1. **Initialization:** Generate an initial population of potential solutions (binary strings representing item selection).
2. **Fitness Function:** Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population based on the total value of the selected items.
3. **Selection:** Select parents from the population for crossover using tournament selection.
4. **Crossover:** Perform crossover (recombination) on pairs of parents to produce offspring (children).
5. **Mutation:** Apply mutation to the children to introduce diversity in the population.
6. **Replacement:** Combine the mutated children with the original parent population and select the fittest individuals for the next generation.
7. **Termination:** Repeat steps 2-6 for a fixed number of generations.

## Usage
1. **Dependencies:** This script requires Python 3.x.
2. **Running the Script:** Execute the script in a Python environment. The best solution found by the genetic algorithm, along with its total value, will be printed.

## Parameters
- `populationSize`: The size of the population.
- `weightList` and `valueList`: Lists containing the weights and values of the items, respectively.
- `bagSize`: The capacity of the knapsack.
- `k`: Tournament size for parent selection.
- `m`: Mutation rate.
- `max_gen`: Maximum number of generations.

## Example
```python
python knapsack_ga.py
```
